'''
We are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.

If the players guess is higher than the actual number the program display lower number please.
Similarly the users guess is too low  the program prints higher number please.
When the user guesses the correct number the program displays the number of guesses 
the player used to arrive at the number.

import random
n=random.randint(1,100)
a=-1
guesses=1
while(a!=n):
  
  a=int(input("Guess the number: "))
  if(a>n):
    print("Lower number please: ")
    guesses+=1
  elif(a<n):
    print("Higher number please: ")
    guesses+=1


print(f"You have guessed the number {n} correctly in {guesses} attempt")
